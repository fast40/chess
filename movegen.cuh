 * @brief Move generation for chess.
 *
 * Move generation is the core computational task of the chess simulator. For each
 * position, we enumerate every legal move, then pick one uniformly at random. This
 * file builds up the move generator piece by piece (literally).
 *
 * NOTE: [thought process] We generate pseudo-legal moves here — moves that follow piece
 * movement rules but might leave the king in check. A separate legality filter removes
 * illegal moves afterward. This two-phase approach is standard in chess engines because
 * it simplifies each piece's move generator: they don't need to reason about pins,
 * discovered checks, or other king-safety concerns.

// NOTE: [performance improvement] On the GPU, this loop-per-ray approach causes thread
// divergence because different games may have different blocker positions, leading to
// different loop lengths within a warp. The Kogge-Stone fill algorithm computes ray
// attacks using only shifts and ORs (no loops), which eliminates this divergence. It's
// a natural optimization target once correctness is established.

// NOTE: [pedagogical] Each direction is encoded as a (file_delta, rank_delta) pair. To
// walk along a ray, we repeatedly add file_delta to the file and rank_delta to the rank.
